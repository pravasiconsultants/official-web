## Essential Skills Work Visa

This is a work visa based purely on skills and experience, and on the requirements of the employer.

This application may be subject to a Labour Market Check (LMC) with Work and Income NZ (WINZ) to ensure that local New Zealanders are protected.

When the offered salary is the same or higher than the median salary, you may be granted a 3 year work visa, and if lower, a 1 or 2 year work visa may be granted.

We suggest to please contact us due to the ever changing requirements and specific conditions that you need to satisfy and meet for an approval.

## Post Study Work Visa

When an international student completes their studies, they can choose to apply for a post study open work visa to stay in New Zealand and work to gain experience for up to 3 years. The length of the visa depends on the study completed. There are health and character requirements that have to be met.

## Religious Work Visa

A religious worker can come to New Zealand on a religious work visa if they have at least 2 years of experience. This is a possible pathway to residence, if the religious worker is sponsored by a religious organisation.

## Partnership Work Visa

If you are the partner of a New Zealand Citizen, Resident or Work Visa holder, then you are eligible to apply for a partnership based work visa.
