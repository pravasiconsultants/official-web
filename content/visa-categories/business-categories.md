## Business Visa

Business people have a choice in the type of application they wish to apply under that will allow them to work and gain residence in New Zealand.

Business people may use one of the following visas that will allow them to work and gain residence in New Zealand. The various criteria are described under each individual application type.

### Entrepreneur Work Visa

The New Zealand Government wishes to attract talented, enterprising, well-connected business people to invest and grow businesses in New Zealand.

The **Entrepreneur Work Visa** operates under a points-based system that will result in higher quality, more productive businesses.

Points will be offered for criteria including age, job creation, export potential, and business experience. A minimum capital investment will also be required to ensure applicants have the means to create high growth and innovative businesses.

Please follow this link to view the current [Entrepreneur Work Visa Points Table](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/opsmanual/index.htm#48308.htm).

This policy encourages innovative, export focused businesses, while demonstrating a commitment of the Government to the regions.

It is expected that these changes will attract talented, entrepreneurial migrants who can invest in New Zealand communities, grow profitable businesses, and create jobs for New Zealanders around the country.

### Entrepreneur Residence Class Visa

Residence may be obtained under the Entrepreneur Residence Visa.

**Under the six month option,** where the applicant has been self employed in the business for 6 months, and has invested at least 0,000 (excl working capital), and has created at least 3 full time jobs for NZ residents/citizens, and have a Entrepreneur Work Visa or LTBV at the time that they lodge this application.

**Under the two year option**, where the applicant has two years of successful self-employment in the business on an open work visa or in a business approved under the Entrepreneur Work Visa or LTBV category, an application for residence may be lodged under the Entrepreneur category.

Applicants must provide clear evidence that they have met the above described criteria, added value to an existing business and created employment for New Zealand residents and or citizens as per business plan.

Certain other criteria are also required to be met.

### Accreditation

This application is for Employers who wish to supplement their current work force with skills and experience not readily available in New Zealand.

The company is required to submit information regarding their financial viability and sustainability and that they are an ethical employer. Other specific requirements include for instance the salary payable.
