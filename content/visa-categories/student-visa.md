#### Study Visa

A student visa allows you to study full time in New Zealand. Students who are undertaking a course of 12 months or more are eligible to work for 20 hours per week and full time during Christmas Holidays. After graduating from a course that would qualify for points under the Skilled Migrant Category, students are eligible to apply for a Post Study Work Visa without an offer of employment. After this Post Study Work Visa it is possible to apply for an Essential Skills Work Visa (2-3 years) with an offer of employment relevant to their course/qualifications.

#### Free Study Guidance
