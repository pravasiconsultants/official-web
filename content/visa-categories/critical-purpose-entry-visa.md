The New Zealand Border is closed for most overseas people dues to COVID-19 restrictions. If you would like to travel to New Zealand, you need a critical purpose visa while the border is closed. You can apply for this visa if you have a critical purpose for coming to New Zealand and Immigration New Zealand invites you to apply. To get an invitation to apply, you must request for travel. If you already have a visa, you can request an invitation to vary the conditions to let you travel for a critical purpose. New Zealand employers can request Immigration New Zealand to allow them to bring critical workers into New Zealand.
